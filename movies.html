  <!-- All Quiet on the Western Front (2022) -->
  <div class="card">
    <div class="placeholder"><span>Poster coming soon</span></div>
    <div class="info">
      <div class="title">All Quiet on the Western Front</div>
      <div class="meta">2022 • War / Anti-war drama</div>
      <div class="desc">
        A teenager enlists full of patriotic excitement, only to be thrown into trench warfare where survival becomes the only goal.
        The film follows how fear, hunger, and constant shelling erase the idea of “glory” and turn friendship into a lifeline.
        It’s not a heroic war movie — it’s a suffocating look at what war does to the body and the mind.
        Best for viewers who want realism and atmosphere over inspiration.

  <!-- One Battle After Another (2025) -->

    <div class="placeholder"><span>Poster coming soon</span></div>
    <div class="info">
      <div class="title">One Battle After Another</div>
      <div class="meta">2025 • Thriller / Dark comedy vibe</div>
      <div class="desc">
        A high-pressure story built around conflict that keeps evolving — the kind where every choice creates a new problem.
        It leans into paranoia, momentum, and people making decisions under stress, then having to live with the fallout.
        If you like stories where tension doesn’t stop and characters get boxed in by consequences, this fits that mood.
        (We can refine this synopsis more once you tell me the exact plot you want described.)

  <!-- The Intern (2015) -->
  <div class="card">
    <div class="placeholder"><span>Poster coming soon</span></div>
    <div class="info">
      <div class="title">The Intern</div>
      <div class="meta">2015 • Feel-good comedy-drama</div>
      <div class="desc">
        A retired man joins a fashion e-commerce company as a senior intern and ends up becoming the calm presence everyone didn’t know they needed.
        At the center is a young founder juggling ambition, pressure, and a life that’s moving faster than she can manage.
        It’s a gentle movie about work, self-worth, and the kind of support that doesn’t come with judgement.
        Perfect if you want something warm, clean, and genuinely comforting.

  <!-- Revenge (2017) -->
  <div class="card">
    <div class="placeholder"><span>Poster coming soon</span></div>
    <div class="info">
      <div class="title">Revenge</div>
      <div class="meta">2017 • Survival / Revenge thriller</div>
      <div class="desc">
        A woman goes on a weekend getaway with a wealthy man, but things turn violent when his friends arrive and boundaries vanish.
        Left for dead in the desert, she survives against all odds — and the film flips into a brutal hunt where the hunted becomes the threat.
        It’s stylish, fast, and intense, with a hard edge and zero softness.
        Best for people who like revenge stories that don’t hold back.

  <!-- Jack Reacher (2012) -->
  <div class="card">
    <div class="placeholder"><span>Poster coming soon</span></div>
    <div class="info">
      <div class="title">Jack Reacher</div>
      <div class="meta">2012 • Action / Mystery</div>
      <div class="desc">
        A sniper is arrested after a public shooting, but the case feels too neat — and a drifting ex-military investigator gets pulled in.
        As he follows the evidence, the story turns into a layered conspiracy where “truth” depends on who controls the narrative.
        It’s part investigation, part street-level action, with a tough, no-nonsense lead.
        Good for viewers who like thrillers with clues, interrogations, and grounded fights.

  <!-- The Exam (2009) -->
  <div class="card">
    <div class="placeholder"><span>Poster coming soon</span></div>
    <div class="info">
      <div class="title">Exam</div>
      <div class="meta">2009 • Psychological thriller</div>
      <div class="desc">
        Eight strangers sit for a final job assessment in a sealed room — but the test paper is blank and the rules are strict.
        With time ticking, the candidates start forming alliances, turning on each other, and testing boundaries to figure out what the “real question” is.
        It’s a minimal, claustrophobic thriller where tension comes from people, not explosions.
        Best if you enjoy mind-games, puzzles, and pressure-cooker stories.

  <!-- Bugonia (2025) -->
  <div class="card">
    <div class="placeholder"><span>Poster coming soon</span></div>
    <div class="info">
      <div class="title">Bugonia</div>
      <div class="meta">2025 • Conspiracy / Dark satire</div>
      <div class="desc">
        Two conspiracy-obsessed men convince themselves a powerful CEO isn’t human — and they decide the only “solution” is to kidnap her.
        The story pushes paranoia to the edge, mixing obsession, fear, and the absurd logic that people build inside their own heads.
        If you like unsettling satire and stories about delusion turning into action, this is that lane.
        (When you want, we can adjust tone here depending on how you want to present it on Popcorn Picks.)

      <div class="title">Meet Joe Black</div>
      <div class="meta">1998 • Romance / Fantasy-drama</div>
      <div class="desc">
        Death takes the body of a young man and spends time with a wealthy businessman, asking for guidance about life on Earth.
        In the process, he experiences love, jealousy, desire, and the strange weight of time running out.
        It’s slow and emotional, built for mood: long conversations, soft heartbreak, and the feeling of saying goodbye before you’re ready.
        Best for viewers who like romantic dramas that linger.

  <!-- Lone Survivor -->
  <div class="card">
    <div class="placeholder"><span>Poster coming soon</span></div>
    <div class="info">
      <div class="title">Lone Survivor</div>
      <div class="meta">War / Survival</div>
      <div class="desc">
        A military mission goes wrong in hostile terrain and turns into a desperate fight to stay alive while being hunted.
        The film focuses on endurance: injuries, fear, brotherhood, and the brutal reality of escaping when everything collapses.
        It’s not about victory — it’s about survival and the cost of every decision made under pressure.
        Best if you want intense, grounded survival tension.

      <div class="title">RRR</div>
      <div class="meta">2022 • Indian epic / Action-drama</div>
      <div class="desc">
        Two men meet in colonial India and form a deep friendship — but both are living with hidden missions that can destroy that bond.
        What starts as brotherhood becomes a test of loyalty, identity, and sacrifice as their worlds collide.
        It’s huge, emotional, and made for big-screen energy: spectacle, music, and moments designed to hit hard.
        Best if you want maximum cinema — not subtle realism.
