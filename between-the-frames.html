    <h2 class="sectionTitle">Mental fatigue plays a bigger role than we admit</h2>
    <p>
      The reluctance to choose a subtitled film often has very little to do with taste and a lot to do with timing.
      After a long day, most people don’t sit down looking for stimulation. They’re looking for something that feels manageable.
      Something familiar. Something that doesn’t ask too much of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subtitled films, fairly or not, carry a different expectation. They suggest attentiveness, emotional involvement, the need to stay with the screen.
      Even committed viewers of international cinema can pause when they’re drained, aware at some level that the experience may require a kind of focus
      they’re not ready to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When watching becomes a way to unwind rather than engage, choices begin to drift toward what feels easiest to sit with.
      Not because it’s better, but because it fits the moment more comfortably.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2 class="sectionTitle">Habit often wins over intention</h2>
    <p>
      Most people don’t consciously decide against subtitled films. They save them, add them to lists, bookmark recommendations.
      There’s usually an intention to return to them later, when there’s more time or more focus to spare.
      But “later” has a habit of colliding with routines built over years.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the moment to choose arrives, familiarity has an advantage. A known voice. A rhythm that doesn’t require constant attention.
      Dialogue that can be followed even if the mind drifts. The subtitled option is rarely rejected outright. It’s simply postponed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes this difficult to notice is how quiet the decision feels. People don’t think, I don’t want to read subtitles.
      They think, maybe not tonight. And that thought returns, gently, the next time as well.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2 class="sectionTitle">The Parasite quote and what it actually means</h2>
    <p>
      When Bong Joon-ho spoke about subtitles being a one-inch-tall barrier, the line travelled widely, often repeated as encouragement
      and sometimes as a challenge. But the quote works better when read patiently. It isn’t dismissing the difficulty of subtitles.
      It’s pointing to where that difficulty actually lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once viewers settle into a subtitled film, reading rarely remains a conscious effort for long. Eyes adjust. Attention synchronises.
      Emotion comes through expressions, pauses, and silences as much as dialogue. Language becomes one part of a larger experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resistance happens earlier, in the pause before pressing play, when the decision still feels negotiable.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2 class="sectionTitle">When the barrier feels larger than it is</h2>
    <p>
      There’s a quieter anxiety that doesn’t get discussed much: the fear of missing something.
      Subtitles create the sense that attention has to be divided perfectly, eyes moving fast enough, emotions still registering,
      nothing slipping through the cracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though this fear usually fades once the film begins, it’s persuasive enough to steer people toward something safer.
      Something that feels easier to follow, even if it offers less in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Streaming culture has amplified this hesitation. When content is endless, attention becomes cautious.
      Viewers start protecting it, choosing experiences that feel predictable rather than absorbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subtitled films, unfairly, get placed on the later list, the one meant for better moods and clearer evenings.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2 class="sectionTitle">A generational shift</h2>
    <p>
      Younger viewers often show less resistance. Growing up alongside global content, faster reading habits,
      and constant exposure to multiple languages online has made reading on screen feel ordinary rather than disruptive.
    </p>
    <p>
      For them, subtitles aren’t something to overcome. They’re simply part of watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      That difference suggests the issue isn’t fixed or universal. It’s shaped by habit, exposure, and the way watching has been learned over time.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2 class="sectionTitle">The moment before pressing play</h2>
    <p>
      Subtitled films aren’t avoided because people lack curiosity. If anything, curiosity often comes first,
      in recommendations saved, trailers watched, conversations remembered. What gets in the way is something smaller and more ordinary:
      the way watching has slowly changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attention is more divided now. Even moments meant for rest are crowded with notifications, background noise,
      and the expectation that nothing on screen should ask too much. Subtitles don’t fit easily into that rhythm.
      They don’t demand focus loudly, but they don’t fade politely either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noticing this isn’t about fixing habits or choosing differently next time.
      It’s simply about recognising the gap between what we intend to watch and what we actually make room for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barrier, as Bong Joon-ho suggested, is smaller than it feels.
      But it feels real precisely because it appears before the film begins, in that brief pause where deciding still feels optional.
