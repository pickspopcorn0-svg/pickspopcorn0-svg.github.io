    <h1>International Films That Won the Oscar: The Last Decade</h1>

    <p>
      There’s a temptation to treat Oscar wins as verdicts. As if a gold statue settles an argument. It doesn’t.
      At its best, the win is a snapshot. A record of the kind of international cinema that managed to cut through language,
      politics, campaigning, and taste at a particular moment in time.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not a recommendation list. It’s not a canon. It’s a record of what the Academy chose to recognize,
      and what that choice quietly says about the era.

  <h2>2) The Salesman</h2>
  <div class="submeta">Iran • 2016 • Best Foreign Language Film (Oscar Winner)</div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>At first glance, <em>The Salesman</em> looks contained. An apartment. A marriage. A disruption that feels almost ordinary. That ordinariness is the point. Farhadi has never been interested in spectacle. He works in pressure. Quiet pressure that builds not through events, but through decisions people refuse to admit they are making.</p>
    <p>The incident at the center of the film is never treated as a plot twist. There is no dramatic escalation, no clean confrontation designed to satisfy. Instead, the story folds inward. The real damage happens later, in the aftermath. In the way pride hardens. In the way dignity becomes something brittle and dangerous.</p>
    <p>What makes this film linger is not what happens, but how stubbornly the characters refuse to let go of their self image. Justice becomes less important than control. Compassion becomes conditional. Farhadi never moralizes this. He simply lets the silence stretch long enough for discomfort to settle in.</p>
    <p>Its Oscar win felt less like a celebration of one film and more like recognition of a certain kind of cinema. Intimate, morally tense, and uncomfortably human.</p>

  <h2>3) A Fantastic Woman</h2>
  <div class="submeta">Chile • 2017 • Best Foreign Language Film (Oscar Winner)</div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>What stands out about <em>A Fantastic Woman</em> is how little it asks for permission. The film does not argue for its protagonist’s right to exist. It assumes it. The resistance comes from the world around her, from institutions, families, and social rituals that reveal their cruelty through casual exclusion rather than open violence.</p>
    <p>Grief sits at the center of the film, but it is never allowed to become sentimental. Every moment of vulnerability is met with suspicion. Even mourning becomes something that must be justified. The camera stays steady, refusing to frame its lead as either a victim or a symbol. She is simply there, enduring.</p>
    <p>The Oscar mattered here in a different way. Not because the film was radical in form, but because of what it normalized. Representation without explanation. Identity without translation. The Academy recognizing a film that does not pause to educate its audience felt quietly significant.</p>
    <p>It was a win rooted in presence rather than provocation.</p>

  <h2>4) Roma</h2>
  <div class="submeta">Mexico • 2018 • Best Foreign Language Film (Oscar Winner)</div>
  <div class="text">
    <p><em>Roma</em> unfolds like memory does. Slowly. Selectively. Without clear emphasis. Cuarón doesn’t guide attention through plot but through observation. The camera watches. It waits. Life moves forward while meaning accumulates almost accidentally.</p>
    <p>The film is not interested in drama in the conventional sense. Major events happen offhandedly. Smaller moments linger. A domestic worker’s routine becomes the emotional spine of the film, not because it is extraordinary, but because it has always been overlooked.</p>
    <p>Class exists here without speeches. Politics without declarations. Love without sentimentality. Everything is framed at a distance that feels respectful rather than cold. The black and white imagery does not romanticize the past. It flattens it, making memory feel both intimate and unreachable.</p>
    <p>The Oscar win represented a rare alignment. A personal film that refused narrative urgency still managed to connect globally.</p>

  <h2>5) Parasite</h2>
  <div class="submeta">South Korea • 2019 • Best International Feature Film (Oscar Winner)</div>
  <div class="text">
    <p><em>Parasite</em> moves with confidence. It never pauses to announce its intelligence. It simply keeps shifting. Comedy becomes tension. Tension becomes violence. Social commentary slips in through architecture, space, and routine rather than dialogue.</p>
    <p>What made the film resonate globally was not just its themes, but its precision. Every tonal shift feels earned. Every genre turn feels intentional. Class division is not discussed. It is built into the geography of the film, into staircases, basements, and windows that frame who gets light and who does not.</p>
    <p>Its Oscar win did more than reward a single film. It broke the assumption that international cinema needed to stay contained within its category. Language stopped being framed as a barrier. This was not recognition by exception. It was recognition by inevitability.</p>

  <h2>6) Another Round</h2>
  <div class="submeta">Denmark • 2020 • Best International Feature Film (Oscar Winner)</div>
  <div class="text">
    <p><em>Another Round</em> begins as an experiment and ends as something closer to a confession. Four men test a theory about alcohol and performance, but what unfolds is a quiet examination of stagnation. Of lives that feel complete on paper and hollow in practice.</p>
    <p>The film never condemns its characters, nor does it celebrate their behavior. It allows contradictions to coexist. Joy appears unexpectedly. Consequences follow quietly. Midlife dissatisfaction is treated not as crisis, but as accumulation.</p>
    <p>Its win reflected something subtle. A willingness to recognize films that sit between tones. Neither tragedy nor comedy. Neither warning nor endorsement. Just observation.</p>

  <h2>7) Drive My Car</h2>
  <div class="submeta">Japan • 2021 • Best International Feature Film (Oscar Winner)</div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>This is a film that breathes. Long conversations. Extended silences. Repetition that feels deliberate rather than indulgent. <em>Drive My Car</em> does not rush grief. It lets it settle into daily life, into routine, into work.</p>
    <p>The car becomes a space of quiet confrontation. A place where emotions surface slowly, often indirectly. The film trusts its audience completely. Nothing is underlined. Nothing is resolved neatly.</p>
    <p>Its Oscar win was notable precisely because of its restraint. In an era defined by speed, the Academy acknowledged a film that insists on patience.</p>

  <h2>8) All Quiet on the Western Front</h2>
  <div class="submeta">Germany • 2022 • Best International Feature Film (Oscar Winner)</div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>This version of <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em> is stripped of nostalgia. There is no sense of legacy or honor. Only exhaustion. Mud. Hunger. Repetition. Death feels mechanical rather than tragic.</p>
    <p>The film refuses to mythologize youth or sacrifice. It shows war as a system that consumes without meaning. The distance between political decisions and individual suffering is made brutally clear.</p>
    <p>Its recognition pointed toward a renewed appetite for unsentimental war storytelling. One that does not ask for admiration, only attention.</p>

  <h2>9) The Zone of Interest</h2>
  <div class="submeta">United Kingdom / Poland • 2023 • Best International Feature Film (Oscar Winner)</div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>Perhaps the most unsettling film in this group, <em>The Zone of Interest</em> does almost nothing directly. Atrocities remain largely unseen. The horror exists in sound. In routine. In how normal everything appears.</p>
    <p>The film’s power comes from what it refuses to show. Evil is not dramatized. It is normalized. Domestic life continues beside unimaginable violence, not through denial, but through accommodation.</p>
    <p>This Oscar win felt less like celebration and more like acknowledgment. A recognition of cinema that confronts history by stepping sideways rather than forward.</p>

</article>

  <div class="note">
    Taken together, these films do not form a canon. They form a record. Of moments when international cinema aligned with global attention.
    Of what was visible. Of what was acceptable. Of what briefly broke through. That is what this piece is meant to hold.
