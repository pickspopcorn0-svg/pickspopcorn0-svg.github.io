    <h1>My Favorite Donghua</h1>

    <p>
      Donghua is not just animation. It is epic storytelling built on cultivation, destiny, ancient bloodlines,
      and the slow climb from weakness to power. When it works, it feels like myth turned into motion.
    </p>

    <p>
      These four series represent the core flavors of modern donghua: long journeys, deep worlds, and characters
      who change through suffering, discipline, loyalty, and obsession.
    </p>

  <h2>1) Soul Land</h2>
  <div class="submeta">Cultivation • Found family • Destiny</div>

  <div class="text">
    <p>
      Soul Land is not loved because it is flashy. It is loved because it understands what cultivation stories are really about:
      growth that is earned, not gifted.
    </p>

    <p>
      At its heart, it is a long journey of identity. A boy is reborn into a new world and slowly discovers that power is not something you grab.
      It is something you build through discipline, relationships, sacrifice, and pain. The series takes its time explaining its rules,
      from spirit rings to clans to academies, and that patience is exactly why the world feels real.
    </p>

    <p>
      The strongest part of Soul Land is the team. Tang San matters, but he becomes legendary because of the people beside him.
      Their loyalty, jealousy, fear, pride, and love give weight to every breakthrough. When someone levels up here,
      it feels like a life milestone, not a visual effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the kind of donghua where you remember where the characters began, who they lost, and why the next step forward matters.
      If donghua has a gateway masterpiece, this is it.
    </p>

  <h2>2) Battle Through the Heavens</h2>
  <div class="submeta">Underdog • Revenge fuel • Power progression</div>

  <div class="text">
    <p>
      If Soul Land is about bonds and destiny, Battle Through the Heavens is about hunger.
      The story begins with humiliation. A talented boy loses everything and becomes someone people mock.
      That bitterness is not just a starting point, it is the engine.
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes this donghua addictive is how directly it connects power to pain. Every fight carries personal pressure,
      every breakthrough feels like a response to someone who tried to crush him. The world is ruthless: clans destroy each other,
      alliances last only until someone becomes stronger, and “talent” means nothing if you cannot survive.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is one of the most satisfying rise-from-nothing stories in cultivation. Not because it is “cool,”
      but because it makes you feel the cost of becoming dangerous.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the hero finally stands above the people who once looked down on him, it feels earned.
      That is why this one stays in your head.

<article class="show">
  <h2>3) Perfect World</h2>
  <div class="submeta">Mythic scale • Ancient realms • Bloodline wars</div>

  <div class="text">
    <p>
      Perfect World is donghua at its most mythic. This is not a small personal story.
      It is a universe of gods, monsters, forbidden techniques, ancient clans, and civilizations that rise and collapse.
    </p>

    <p>
      What separates it is scale. The hero does not just fight enemies, he fights history.
      Every realm feels older and more dangerous than the last. There is always something behind the present:
      ancestors watching, grudges buried in the land, secrets sealed for thousands of years.
    </p>

    <p>
      The battles here are not just action. They feel like clashes between legacies and philosophies.
      That is why the show feels epic even when it slows down: it is building the sense that the world itself is heavy.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want cultivation fantasy that feels like legend being written in real time, Perfect World is essential.

  <h2>4) Shrouding the Heavens</h2>
  <div class="submeta">Atmospheric • Deep lore • Ancient mysteries</div>

  <div class="text">
    <p>
      Shrouding the Heavens is the most atmospheric of the four. Where others push forward with hype,
      this one moves like an ancient manuscript being slowly revealed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cultivation here is not only power. It is knowledge. It is discovering what was buried before your era began.
      The universe feels old in spirit, not just old in years. There are forgotten empires, sealed gods, lost techniques,
      and secrets that could break the present if uncovered.
    </p>

    <p>
      The story builds tension through mystery and scale. It makes you feel that the world is bigger than the hero,
      and that every clue is dangerous. This is donghua for people who love lore, not just fights.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you enjoy slow pressure, ancient secrets, and cosmic atmosphere, this one hits different.
