    <h1>Your First Steps Into Indian Cinema</h1>

    <p>
      Indian cinema is not one style. It is not one genre. It is not even one industry.
      It is emotion, excess, intimacy, music, spectacle, and sincerity all living in the same space.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you come in expecting quiet realism, you might be confused.
      If you come in ready to feel something big, you might fall in love.
      These four films are the best place to start.
    </p>

    <h2>Your First Step into Indian Cinema</h2>
    <p class="sectionLead">
      These films are not here to impress you with scale or numbers. They are here to help you
      understand how Indian cinema thinks, feels, and remembers.
    </p>

    <!-- 1. 3 Idiots -->
    <article class="film">
      <h2>1) 3 Idiots</h2>
      <div class="submeta">Friendship • Youth • Pressure • Hope</div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          3 Idiots works as an entry point because it speaks a language that is familiar to almost
          everyone. College friendships. Academic pressure. Parents who mean well but push too hard.
          A system that measures intelligence with ranks instead of curiosity.
        </p>

        <p>
          It starts light and funny, almost careless. Slowly, the jokes give way to something more
          uncomfortable. You begin to notice how fear shapes choices, how success is narrowly defined,
          and how easily young people disappear inside expectations that are not their own.
        </p>

        <p>
          What stays with you is not a scene or a speech, but the emotional recognition. Many people
          see themselves or someone they knew in these characters. That is why the film still connects
          years later and across cultures.
        </p>

        <p>
          If someone has never seen an Indian film before, this one explains the emotional grammar
          without asking for any background knowledge.

    <!-- 2. Andhadhun -->
    <article class="film">
      <h2>2) Andhadhun</h2>
      <div class="submeta">Dark thriller • Twisted comedy • Moral uncertainty</div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Andhadhun is the film you show someone who thinks Indian cinema is predictable.
        </p>

        <p>
          A pianist pretends to be blind in order to focus on his art. That lie places him at the wrong
          place at the worst possible time. From there, the story keeps folding in on itself. Every
          decision creates a new problem. Every character hides something.
        </p>

        <p>
          The film never tells you how to feel. It allows situations to play out and lets the audience
          sit with the consequences. Humor exists, but it is sharp and uncomfortable, not comforting.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is Indian cinema choosing ambiguity over reassurance. It trusts the viewer. That trust
          is what makes it so effective.

    <!-- 3. RRR -->
    <article class="film">
      <h2>3) RRR</h2>
      <div class="submeta">Friendship • Freedom • Mythic action</div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          RRR is not subtle, and it does not try to be. It understands exactly what it wants to do and
          commits to it fully.
        </p>

        <p>
          Two men from opposite sides of colonial India meet by chance and form a powerful bond. What
          they do not know is that their loyalties will eventually pull them apart. The film builds
          its emotions large because the story itself is designed as a modern myth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beneath the spectacle is something very simple. Friendship tested by duty. Personal loyalty
          clashing with a larger cause. The reason the film works is not just the action, but the
          sincerity behind it.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is Indian cinema at its most unapologetic and confident. If you want to understand how
          scale and emotion coexist here, RRR makes that clear.
        </p>

    <!-- 4. Baahubali Duology -->
    <article class="film">
      <h2>4) Baahubali: The Beginning &amp; The Conclusion</h2>
      <div class="submeta">Epic fantasy • Power • Betrayal</div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          The Baahubali films function like folklore retold at full volume.
        </p>

        <p>
          A kingdom shaped by legend. A hero whose past has been deliberately buried. A betrayal that
          defines an entire generation. The two films work as one continuous story about power, pride,
          and the cost of choosing righteousness over convenience.
        </p>

        <p>
          What matters here is not realism but emotional clarity. Characters are driven by loyalty,
          ambition, love, and revenge. Everything is heightened, but nothing is random.
        </p>

        <p>
          Watching Baahubali helps explain why Indian cinema often embraces mythic storytelling. It is
          not escapism. It is a way of turning moral questions into shared memory.
        </p>

    <!-- 5. Dangal -->
    <article class="film">
      <h2>5) Dangal</h2>
      <div class="submeta">Discipline • Family • Resistance</div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Dangal looks like a sports film, but its real subject is control.
        </p>

        <p>
          A former wrestler trains his daughters to compete in a system that is stacked against them.
          The film does not present him as flawless. His ambition helps his daughters, but it also
          limits them.
        </p>

        <p>
          What makes Dangal effective is its balance. It celebrates achievement without ignoring the
          emotional cost of relentless discipline. It asks difficult questions about authority and
          freedom without turning anyone into a villain.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a grounded, accessible film that still carries weight beyond its genre.

      <h2>6) The Lunchbox</h2>
      <div class="submeta">Loneliness • Routine • Human connection</div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          The Lunchbox is quiet in a way that feels almost rare.
        </p>

        <p>
          A mistaken lunch delivery connects two strangers living very different lives. What follows
          is not romance in the conventional sense, but companionship built through words, routine,
          and patience.
        </p>

        <p>
          The film understands urban loneliness deeply. It pays attention to small gestures, everyday
          habits, and the emotional weight of ordinary days.
        </p>

        <p>
          For someone new to Indian cinema, this film shows that restraint and tenderness exist here
          just as strongly as spectacle.

      <div class="submeta">History • Grief • Quiet anger</div>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Sardar Udham is not interested in patriotic noise.
        </p>

        <p>
          It follows a revolutionary whose life is shaped by trauma rather than slogans. The film
          moves slowly, allowing history to settle instead of rushing toward catharsis.
        </p>

        <p>
          Violence is shown as something that scars rather than empowers. Anger exists, but it is
          controlled and internal. The weight of colonial brutality is allowed to speak for itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a mature historical film that trusts silence more than speeches.
