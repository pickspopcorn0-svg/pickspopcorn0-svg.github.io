    <h1>Your First Steps Into Indian Cinema</h1>

    <p>
      Indian cinema is not one style. It is not one genre. It is not even one industry.
      It is emotion, excess, intimacy, music, spectacle, and sincerity all living in the same space.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you come in expecting quiet realism, you might be confused.
      If you come in ready to feel something big, you might fall in love.
      These four films are the best place to start.

    <h2>1) 3 Idiots</h2>
    <div class="submeta">Friendship • Youth • Pressure • Hope</div>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        <em>3 Idiots</em> is the emotional doorway into Indian cinema.  
        It is about friendship, family pressure, fear of failure, and the way society pushes young people into lives they did not choose.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes it special is that it balances comedy and pain without losing sincerity. One moment you are laughing.
        The next moment you are quietly thinking about your own life.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have never seen an Indian film before, this is the one that makes you feel welcome.
        It does not ask you to understand Indian culture. It asks you to understand being human.

    <h2>2) Andhadhun</h2>
    <div class="submeta">Dark thriller • Twisted comedy • Moral chaos</div>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        <em>Andhadhun</em> exists to destroy a stereotype.
        Many people think Indian films are only emotional and musical.
        This film proves they can be sharp, cruel, clever, and unpredictable.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a thriller that constantly changes its rules.
        You think you understand what kind of story you are watching and then it shifts under your feet.
        Characters lie, survive, betray, and improvise in ways that feel dangerous and funny at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the film you show someone who doubts that Indian cinema can be intellectually bold.

    <h2>3) RRR</h2>
    <div class="submeta">Friendship • Freedom • Mythic action • Pure cinema</div>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        <em>RRR</em> is not subtle.  
        It does not try to be realistic.  
        It does not care about understatement.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is unapologetically over the top, emotional, loud, and heroic.
        Men fight tigers. They jump through explosions. They cry. They sing. They bleed.
        And somehow, it all still has heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why it works.  
        It is not trying to impress critics. It is trying to make you feel something.
        That sincerity, combined with insane spectacle, is why the world responded to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is Indian cinema at its most confident and wild.

    <h2>4) Baahubali: The Beginning & Baahubali: The Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="submeta">Epic fantasy • Royal betrayal • Myth and revenge</div>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        <em>Baahubali</em> is not just a movie. It is an event.
        It is built like an ancient legend told with modern technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        The story is simple but powerful.  
        Who was Baahubali?  
        Why was he betrayed?  
        And what does his son do when he learns the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
        These two films work together as one giant epic.
        They give you palaces, wars, romance, betrayal, and heroic sacrifice.
        The emotions are big, the visuals are bold, and the story moves like a myth passed down through generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If RRR shows Indian cinema’s energy, Baahubali shows its ability to build worlds.
