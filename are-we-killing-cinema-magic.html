      On trailers, overexposure, and what happens when discovery disappears.

    <p>
      There was a time when going to the movies meant stepping into the unknown.
      You bought a ticket because you trusted a name, a poster, or a feeling.
      You didn’t know the rhythm of the story. You didn’t know which scene would make the crowd gasp.
      You didn’t even know who might walk onto the screen halfway through and completely change the film.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, that sense of discovery is quietly disappearing.
      Before the lights go off, we already know too much.
      The tone. The emotional peaks. The moments designed to make people cheer, cry, or jump.
      Sometimes we even know the twist, not because we searched for it, but because it was placed everywhere.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sectionTitle">When knowing too much changes how we watch</h2>

    <p>
      Trailers are no longer teasers. They are explanations.
      They map relationships, hint at arcs, and preview the most striking visuals a film has to offer.
      Add social media into the mix and the film starts to feel familiar before it even begins.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result, we don’t discover scenes anymore. We recognise them.
      We don’t react instinctively. We anticipate.
      The film is still playing, but part of us is already ahead of it.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sectionTitle">Surprise is one of cinema’s most powerful emotions</h2>

    <p>
      Surprise sharpens attention. It deepens memory.
      Many of the scenes we remember most are not just well-made.
      They are moments we did not see coming.
    </p>

    <p>
      When surprise is removed, impact is reduced.
      A shocking scene can still work, but it will never hit as hard as it would have
      if experienced for the first time inside a dark theatre.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sectionTitle">Trying to walk in blind</h2>

    <p>
      Avoiding overexposure today is genuinely difficult.
      Even when you try, clips appear, thumbnails autoplay, moments are spoiled without warning.
      Most of the time, we give in.
    </p>

    <p>
      But once, I didn’t.
      I walked into a film knowing almost nothing.
      No trailer. No cast breakdown. No mapped relationships.
      And even though the film itself was not perfect, the experience felt fuller.
    </p>

    <p>
      Characters surprised me.
      Appearances landed harder.
      I was watching, not comparing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sectionTitle">When trailers steal the best moments</h2>

    <p>
      Horror and thrillers suffer the most.
      Jump scares and shock moments are now marketing tools.
      They grab attention online, but inside the theatre they lose their power.
    </p>

    <p>
      A scare you expect is not a scare.
      It is a reminder.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sectionTitle">Why this idea sounds idealistic</h2>

    <p>
      Not every film deserves blind trust.
      Trailers help us filter in an era where time is limited.
      That reality matters.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the idea here is smaller.
      Once a year. One filmmaker you trust.
      One project where curiosity matters more than certainty.
    </p>

    <h2 class="sectionTitle">Maybe mystery is the last luxury cinema has</h2>

    <p>
      In a world where everything is previewed and explained,
      mystery itself has become rare.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cinema was once about discovery.
      Maybe it still can be, if we allow ourselves to experience it that way again.
      Not always. Not blindly.
      But intentionally.
